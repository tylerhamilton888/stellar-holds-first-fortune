# 0.63.0 — Living terraces (corrected candidate; publication pending)

Base milestone PR #8 merged at 09666eaf2ba6f06598b3f0ac52249615243d3be2 after full native gameplay run 39650360972 passed. Final visual review then caught an adjacent-ward resident hidden by shared stair artwork. Correction PR #9 is 6d2752e4a595c415257b58f00fd2825aea7609be: adjacent-flight residents now join the active foreground sort at their translated coordinates, without changing ownership or drawing twice. Native correction checks: 51 passed, no script errors. The corrected exact PCK passed all 97 checks. Do not deliver the earlier local package without this correction.

Corrected full source gate 39656307242 and publisher 39656676389 are running. Release candidate 472e12bf47c0784c84f3e763da7778dc9cbe740e has the corrected runtime plus evidence/release orchestration. It prepares the package while source validation runs, then requires full source success and exact-package checks before publication. The job has 55 minutes so source waiting, cold import and export checks fit. Earlier publisher runs were deliberately cancelled/paused; no 0.63.0 release has been confirmed yet. Latest confirmed download remains 0.62.1 until publication is verified.

Local verified-living67-visibility / 13f1043dce58845757b76103233b04e7d1bda8a7 and verified-living67-visibility.bundle preserve the corrected source/evidence. The verified bundle requires pre-living-hold67 / 1401303d8bfd0bda6ccd4e8a30244580aae49f3a. Older tags, bundles and releases are untouched. Local restored history differs from GitHub; never force-replace remote history. The corrected clean local build 2e9b17883c977855f1697c447da4a949cc82062d passed all 3,157 pack-entry and ZIP checks; its digest is not the later hosted asset's digest.

HoldTerraces connects three saved wards in continuous projected space (stride 1740), preserving camera/gait and loaded carts across normal movement. HoldRoutines compiles nine home/work/tavern journeys per seed, samples saved elapsed time and releases navigation grids. Only active/visible adjacent architecture and residents draw. Public rovers and story hosts retain previous behavior. HoldRoomLayout owns the larger forge; HoldMasonryArt uses assets/hold-kit67. Carved pillars and low workshop tables share the existing build/collision/save catalogue; tables are decoration, not another processing system.

Preserve the approved player walk: only preparation changed, not player artwork/descriptors. Distinct interiors, service stairs/lift, mining, forestry, economy and save schema remain. This is bounded terraced architecture, not arbitrary 3D occlusion or a complete population/economic simulation. Read testing/living67.md, testing/living67/visibility.md and PLAYTEST_GUIDE.md. Use suite living/full gameplay and check_pack.py for future exports. Windows hardware/audio and artistic acceptance still need the player's machine.

# 0.62.1 session handoff

Published release v0.62.1: one Windows ZIP at https://github.com/tylerhamilton888/stellar-holds-first-fortune/releases/tag/v0.62.1. Release source 7c51669f17b94ceb835b99fa9572f03e75cad880; hosted build report and published digest are verified in testing/continuity66/hosted-build.json. The release job completed all gameplay and exact-pack gates. Continue from GitHub main; preserve the player walk and this release.

Runtime merged through PR #6: 285a2bc41c827b415a51ce3c284e3335b5342d43. Full hosted gameplay validation 39611887147 passed. Work: polish/continuity66. Verified starting remote main: a669d925f27f6f04b9bffdae88efafc72cf9ddac (0.62.0); hosted validation 39497203974 succeeded. Local pre-continuity66 preserves the restored baseline d720885 and all older recovery bundles remain untouched. Remote history must not be force-replaced by the local restored history.

Read CURRENT_STATUS and testing/continuity66.md. New personal story: letters.gd, surface points, onboarding journal. Facade rectangles and lower-floor projection: world_zones.gd. Stair geometry and residential layout: hold_neighborhood.gd; timed traversal and bedside approach: surface.gd. NPC-only passing keys: assets/town-walk66 and the town_walk descriptor; normal player/core/motion assets are unchanged. The user's latest instruction explicitly approved the player walk and identified townsfolk as the problem. Do not replace the player walk.

Verified source checkpoint: remote 7d7e7d75c4e07de37ed49b0c1817441f48b5158b (PR #6), local verified-continuity66 / aa75c504. All 46 changed remote paths matched local Git blob hashes. 254 distinct source checks plus 35 final repeats and 46 exact-pack checks passed. Incremental recovery bundle verified without replacing older backups.

Run tools/check.py suites continuity and locomotion; exports additionally use tools/check_pack.py from empty working/save folders. Include town-walk66/frames.json in exports. Bump HoldBuild.VERSION for any later art/cache changes. Cutaway cost is bounded to one adjacent ward's clipped facades, with no second viewport or NPC simulation. Further continuous floor occlusion/architectural overlap remains backlog.

Windows release workflow builds only a deliberate release/<version> branch. It verifies the official runtime hash, full gameplay, PCK inventory, ZIP integrity and exact exported gameplay before creating a new versioned release. An already successful full source gate can be reused only after tracked-file equality is checked (documentation and release orchestration excluded); a running matching gate is awaited. It refuses to replace an existing release. No personal saves or credentials belong in the repository.

# 0.62.0 source handoff

Current branch: world/keldrath65. Pre-edit local tag pre-keldrath65 preserves 31dd944; prior modular PR #4 passed hosted CI and merged at a5535e144e298756016152eaa289d3f6ad8dfc11. Older releases and source bundle remain untouched.

Read CURRENT_STATUS and testing/hold65.md. hold_neighborhood.gd owns residential coordinates, homes, stair rail geometry and resident schedules. world_zones.gd integrates those with existing wards. floor_pattern.gd caches original continuous wood/stone meshes and restrained surface grain. surface.gd handles household room links, correct upstairs exits, expanded ward bounds and interaction priority. New IDs are additive room:folk_<ward>_<family>_<floor>; existing save schema, inventory and claimed construction are unchanged. Area IDs carry household level; HUD reports ward-relative absolute Z.

Run tools/check.py --suite hold with isolated native saves. New full gameplay case: tests/hold65.gd. Building bases are explicit physical footprints; painted roofs remain occluding/fading art. Private legacy houses are still closed; nine added family homes are enterable. Resident routines are simple deterministic street/hearth cycles, not a full job/day simulation. No Windows release exported for this source milestone.

# 0.61.3 source handoff

Continue modular placement work on polish/modular64; pre-modular64 preserves local 0.61.2. Read CURRENT_STATUS and testing/modular64.md. Shared grid/footprint renderer: scripts/build_preview.gd. Furniture validation/repositioning: surface.gd. House eligibility: hearthcraft.ready_to_build. Equipment eligibility: handworks.placement_ready. Native gate: tools/check.py --suite modular. Keep previews and commit rules aligned, and preserve chest record identity during moves.

This is an incremental building/collision polish pass, not acceptance of every outstanding animation/art issue. No new Windows release yet. Existing v0.61.2 remains available. Update branch/PR status after integration; do not replace older releases.

# 0.61.2 handoff

Continue from GitHub main. PR #3 merged at `d539cb535fad79fb2bd141ed73e5c3a848ad9bf0`; release `v0.61.2` preserves complete runtime source `4169069d9f80e6fae3dc33deee855c8b16a13916`. The clean local build used `1ab53f235b345ae7a1d5520962fa2ef20d920b95` with matching runtime files. Local `pre-loading63` preserves the prior checkpoint; older releases and the complete foundation source recovery bundle are untouched.

Read CURRENT_STATUS.md, DEVELOPMENT.md and testing/loading63.md. AGENTS.md applies. Title/loading implementation: scripts/loading_view.gd, main.gd and whole_frames.gd. Metadata is HoldBuild.VERSION 0.61.2. The loader uses existing original Keldrath art, job-count progress and a short completion fade. It sits on canvas layer 100 above Ivar and all menus. Existing input/scene gates are retained.

Animation PNGs are derived cache data under user://animation-cache/<version>/. **Bump the build version whenever source artwork, frame metadata or recoloring logic changes.** Do not change or delete saves to clear caches. Cold preparation, engine startup and synchronous world generation remain performance follow-ups. New-character creation randomizes from the canonical appearance/name pools; defaults() remains stable for save migration, and wardrobe mode retains saved identity.

Verification: 190 existing gameplay checks plus 19 final feature checks; the same 19 checks passed against the exported pack. Hosted gameplay CI also passed (39484028846). See testing/loading63 for screenshots, logs, regression summary and build metadata. The initial 11-check loading case was superseded by the 19-check case and is not counted twice. All 3,134 PCK entries and ZIP integrity passed. GitHub asset size/SHA match local. Native Windows and audible mix have not been tested.

Use tools/check.py with tests/suites.json, sequential native rendering and isolated save data. tools/build.py exports one complete Windows ZIP using the pinned official runtime. Full editable source is in GitHub; do not rerun the one-time import workflow or rewrite release tags. Earlier complete bundle remains in release foundation-0.61.1. Further changes should use focused branches and regression evidence.
